# sharewood-oauth2-jwt
I present here a different implementation of the previous project https://github.com/dubersfeld/sharewood-boot-oauth2-upgrade. It uses the Spring Boot version 2.0.4.RELEASE. The main difference is the use of JWT instead of basic tokens. Moreover the JWT are signed using an asymetric key.
